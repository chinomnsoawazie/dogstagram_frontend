# dogstagram_frontend

Dogstagram is an app for dog lovers to acquire dogs, like them, and comment on them. You cannot sell or be parted from the dog for any reason: no one does that to a very loyal best friend. In other words, it is a "for better for worse" relationship with acquired dogs, period!

Eventually decided to split the frontend into the mobile(iOS and Android) part and web part. All will still be done with React Native to ensure uniformity of user experience.
